# Corobot-visual-odometry

Odometry plays a very important role in robotics for
localization, mapping, navigation, SLAM. Traditional odometry
approaches use encoders to measure distance traveled, stepper
motors for precise movements by distance o visual odometry.
Rochester Institute of Technology started corobtics project to
inspire and aid students in learning computing fundamentals and
robotics applications. Corobots uses encoders for odometry which
face precision problems, since wheels slips and slides. Visual
odometry is widely used technique in robotics to overcome this
issue. Corobots have Kinect sensor which produces RGB image
and depth data, which is used for visual odometry in this project.
